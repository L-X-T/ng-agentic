# Angular Performance

A practical guide to making Angular apps fast. Two domains: **initial load** (how fast the
first meaningful paint and interactivity arrive) and **runtime** (how smoothly the app reacts
once loaded). Each fix follows **Problem → Identify → Fix**.

> Targets Angular v17+ and a standalone + signals + OnPush codebase. Module-based notes are
> marked _(legacy)_ for apps not yet migrated.

## 0. Measure first — never guess

Optimize what the tools flag, not what you assume is slow.

- **Initial load / Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP):** Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, WebPageTest.
- **Bundle composition:** `ng build` budget warnings; a source-map/import-graph visualizer to see why code lands in the main chunk.
- **Change detection cost:** **Angular DevTools** profiler (flame chart of CD cycles) and the **Chrome DevTools** Performance panel (Angular-aware, color-coded).
- **Quick CD smell test:** a `blink()` helper or `console.log()` in `ngDoCheck` — if it fires on unrelated interactions, you have out-of-bound CD.

## Part 1 — Initial Load Performance

### 1.1 Assets & build

**Web performance basics** (biggest wins, often outside Angular): HTTP/3 + a CDN, correct browser
caching, Brotli/Gzip compression, modern image formats (`.webp` / `.avif` / `.svg`), and properly
sized images via `srcset`. Clean up and lazy-load unused JS/CSS.

**Production build & tree shaking.** Always ship the production build (`ng build`, optimization on
by default with the `application` builder). Ivy + AOT make the framework, your libs, and 3rd-party
libs tree-shakable. **Avoid large 3rd-party deps and CSS/component frameworks** — they dominate
bundle size.

**Image optimization with `NgOptimizedImage`.** Use `ngSrc` instead of `src`: it lazy-loads
off-screen images, prioritizes above-the-fold ones, and (with an image provider) generates
`srcset`/`sizes` and modern formats. Does **not** work for inline base64 images.

```html
<img ngSrc="hero.jpg" width="800" height="600" priority />
<!-- LCP image -->
<img ngSrc="thumb.jpg" width="120" height="120" />
<!-- lazy by default -->
```

### 1.2 Lazy loading & deferrable views

Goal: ship less JS up front. Trade-off: a small on-demand delay later (mitigate with preloading/prefetch).

**Lazy routes** — split features into their own chunks:

```ts
export const appRoutes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: Home }, // eager (initial feature)
  { path: 'charts', loadComponent: () => import('./charts/charts') }, // standalone, preferred
  { path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.routes') }, // child routes
];
```

**Lazy services** — an `providedIn: 'root'` service used only by one lazy chunk lands in that chunk;
used by several lazy chunks → a shared chunk; used by anything eager → the main bundle. For a
service backed by a heavy library, load it on demand with `injectAsync`.

**Preloading** — after the initial load, fetch lazy chunks before they're needed:

```ts
provideRouter(appRoutes, withPreloading(PreloadAllModules));
```

For big apps prefer a smarter strategy — `ngx-quicklink` (preloads links in the viewport) or a custom one.

**Common pitfalls:**

- **Don't lazy-load the initial feature** (home/login) — it just delays first paint.
- **Don't defeat lazy loading with a huge eager shared module** _(legacy)_ — split it into small focused modules so chunks stay lean.

**Deferrable views (`@defer`)** — lazy-load _parts of a template_ when route-based splitting doesn't
fit (e.g. a heavy 3rd-party widget below the fold). No router needed.

```html
@defer (on viewport; prefetch on idle) {
<app-heavy-chart />
} @placeholder (minimum 500ms) {
<img src="placeholder.avif" alt="" width="420" height="420" />
} @loading (after 500ms; minimum 1s) {
<app-spinner />
} @error {
<p>Couldn't load the chart.</p>
}
```

Triggers: `on idle | viewport | hover | interaction | timer(2s) | immediate`, or `when <boolean>`
(one-time, not reverted). Add `prefetch on …` to fetch ahead of the trigger.

### 1.3 SSR, SSG & hydration

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** — render on the server for fast first paint and SEO; best for public
pages (not behind login). Caveat: no `document` / `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` on the server —
inject browser APIs safely (e.g. `@ng-web-apis/common`).

**Prerendering (SSG)** — render important pages at build time; serves on any static host (nginx/Apache,
no Node needed). Default since v17.

**Hybrid rendering (v19+)** — choose per route:

```ts
{ path: 'charts', renderMode: RenderMode.Client },    // SPA, static files
{ path: 'home',   renderMode: RenderMode.Server },    // SSR, live + hydration
{ path: 'post',   renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender }, // SSG, build-time + hydration
```

**Hydration** — reuse server-rendered DOM on the client instead of re-rendering (avoids flicker):

```ts
provideClientHydration(
  withEventReplay(), // v18+: replay clicks made before hydration finishes
  withIncrementalHydration(), // v19+: hydrate sections lazily, like @defer
);
```

**Incremental hydration** — keep server HTML static until needed, then hydrate on a trigger:

```html
@defer (hydrate on viewport) { <app-section /> }
<!-- also: hydrate on hover|interaction|timer, hydrate when <bool>, hydrate never -->
```

**Alternative:** a URL/edge cache (Cloudflare or any CDN) can stand in for SSR for cacheable pages.

## Part 2 — Runtime Performance

### 2.1 Change detection

CD synchronizes model → DOM, walking the component tree **root → leaves**. With Zone.js it's
triggered by patched events, XHR/`HttpClient`, and `setTimeout`/`setInterval`. The goal is to run CD
**less often** and over **fewer components**.

**Skip subtrees with `OnPush`.** An `OnPush` component is only re-checked when it's "notified":

```ts
@Component({ changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, /* … */ })
```

Notify it by: (1) firing an event inside it/its children, (2) changing a bound `@Input`/input/model
signal **by reference**, (3) emitting through the `async` pipe **or updating a signal** read in the
template, or (4) `cdr.markForCheck()` (escape hatch — `markForCheck()` flags this component up to root
for the next cycle; `detectChanges()` runs CD now for this subtree; `ApplicationRef.tick()` runs the
whole app).

**Make `OnPush` the default:**

```jsonc
"@schematics/angular:component": { "changeDetection": "OnPush" },
// eslint: "@angular-eslint/prefer-on-push-component-change-detection": "warn"
```

**Go zoneless (recommended for new apps).** Drops the Zone.js overhead — CD runs only when signals
change or events fire. Remove `zone.js` from polyfills and provide zoneless CD. Requires that you
notify Angular via signals / `async` pipe / `markForCheck()` (options 2–4 above).

**Fix zone pollution _(zone-based apps)_.** 3rd-party libs (charts, maps), `requestAnimationFrame`,
`setInterval`, or `MouseEvent` listeners can trigger redundant CD cycles. Identify via the DevTools
profiler, then run them outside Angular:

```ts
private readonly zone = inject(NgZone);
this.zone.runOutsideAngular(() => { /* chart animation, rAF loop, … */ });
```

Alternatives: `cdr.detach()` for a self-managing component, or going zoneless.

### 2.2 Slow templates (slow computations)

**Don't call methods or do work in templates** — they re-run every CD cycle.

- **Problem:** redundant calculations in `@if`/interpolation, e.g. `@if (computeExpensive())`.
- **Fix:** precompute into `signal`/`computed` state or boolean flags that change only when they should.
- **Formatting/transforming:** use **pure pipes** — they recompute only when their input reference changes.

### 2.3 Large lists & component trees

**Always `track` in `@for`** (required) — without a stable key Angular destroys and recreates DOM
nodes on every change:

```html
@for (flight of flights(); track flight.id) { … } @empty { No flights found. }
```

Prefer the new control flow (`@for`/`@if`/`@switch`) over `*ngFor`/`*ngIf` _(legacy)_ — it's faster;
migrate with `ng generate @angular/core:control-flow`.

**Avoid huge component trees (100+).** Render on demand: paginate, or use the CDK
`<cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport>` so only visible rows are in the DOM.

### 2.4 Perceived performance (UX)

- **Show the page immediately** with spinners / skeletons / preview thumbnails instead of blocking on the backend.
- **Optimistic updates** for actions like "like"/"save" — apply the change in the UI right away, roll back on error. Don't use it where a wrong result is costly.

### 2.5 RxJS subscription hygiene

Leaked subscriptions keep components alive and re-run work. **Unsubscribe from everything** (the one
exception is Router params). Prefer, in order:

```ts
// 1. async pipe — Angular manages it (also triggers markForCheck for OnPush)
items$ | async
// 2. takeUntilDestroyed() — ties the subscription to the component lifecycle
obs$.pipe(takeUntilDestroyed()).subscribe(…);
// 3. explicit Subscription + unsubscribe() in ngOnDestroy
```

Subscribe in a field initializer/constructor; if you need `@Input`s, use `ngOnInit`; elsewhere inject
`DestroyRef`. Even better — move state to **signals** and avoid manual subscriptions entirely.

## Quick checklist

**Initial load**

- [ ] Production build; watch bundle budgets; drop heavy 3rd-party deps
- [ ] `NgOptimizedImage` (`ngSrc`) with `priority` on the LCP image; modern formats + `srcset`
- [ ] CDN, HTTP/3, Brotli/Gzip, correct caching
- [ ] Lazy-load every feature route (`loadComponent`/`loadChildren`); don't lazy-load the first feature
- [ ] Preload lazy chunks (`PreloadAllModules` or quicklink)
- [ ] `@defer` heavy/below-the-fold pieces, with `prefetch` + placeholder/loading/error
- [ ] SSR/SSG for public pages; hydration with event replay + incremental hydration

**Runtime**

- [ ] `OnPush` everywhere (default schematic + ESLint rule); consider zoneless
- [ ] No method calls / heavy work in templates — use signals/computed/pure pipes
- [ ] `track` in every `@for`; virtual scroll or paginate large lists
- [ ] Run noisy 3rd-party/timer code with `runOutsideAngular` (or go zoneless)
- [ ] Unsubscribe (async pipe / `takeUntilDestroyed`) or use signals
- [ ] Spinners/skeletons + optimistic updates for perceived speed
