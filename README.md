# NG Agentic Engineering

A practical Angular workspace starter with modern best practices, AI-ready tooling, and scalable project setup guidance.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 22.0.0 on June 6th, 2026.

## Generate a new project with the CLI

To start we've created a new Angular project using the `ng new` command:

```shell
ng new ng-agentic
```

This sets up the basic structure of your Angular application, including configuration files, dependencies, and a simple starter component. It also initializes a Git repository for version control.

### Fix initial commit

We fixed the initial commit by removing unnecessary duplications of the `AGENTS.md` instructions and running the following command:

```shell
pnpm format
```

which then executes:

```shell
prettier --write .
```

To avoid doing this manually every time, we can set up a pre-commit hook using Husky to automatically run the formatter before each commit.

## Install & setup Husky

### Install Husky

```shell
pnpm add -D husky
```

### Initialize Husky

```shell
pnpm exec husky init
```

### Update .husky/pre-commit

```shell
pnpm format
```
